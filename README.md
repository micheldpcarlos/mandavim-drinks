# MANDAVIM DRINKS
An app made to track drinks with friends 🍺

- 🤳🏽 Register your drink by taking a picture and selecting the beverage
- 🥇 See how you score in the rankings
- 🍻 Check out the timeline to see nice pictures of drunk guys registering their beers

### Context
Every year I watch the Champions League Final with some friends. We normally rent an Air BnB in a nice place to watch the match, drinking some beer and other alcoholic beverages. But in the latest years, some friends stopped drinking like they used to, and when asked about it, they say they were drinking as usual.

#### ✨ SO I CREATED THIS APP IN 1 DAY ✨

And it is hosted here: https://manda-vim-drinks.web.app/

## NAQ (Never Asked Question)

### Will this project be continued?
Nope. It was made in 1 day and used in another 3 days.

Perhaps next year, in my yearly Champions League session with friends, I revive this project, but just for personal use. 🍺

### Does it follow the best of the best in terms of coding?

Obviously not. I just rushed into it to make it happen. So think about it like a hackathon project. ⏳🧑🏽‍💻

### Is it still working?

I've changed the Firebase permission just to allow reading so it is possible to see the ranking and the timeline pictures.

The registration of new stuff is not allowed anymore 📴
